# Implementation Strategy for infermesh

This document outlines the structured approach for implementing **infermesh**, a GPU-aware inference mesh for large-scale AI serving. The strategy is designed to build incrementally from a minimal viable product to a production-ready distributed system.

---

## 🎯 Overview

**infermesh** is a complex distributed system with three cooperating planes:
- **Data Plane**: Handles inference traffic routing and request forwarding
- **Signal Plane**: Collects runtime and GPU telemetry, provides scoring APIs
- **Control Plane**: Maintains policies, placements, and distributed management

The implementation follows a phased approach aligned with the project roadmap (v0.1 → v1.0), ensuring each phase delivers working functionality while building toward the complete vision.

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Technical Principles

- **Incremental Development**: Each phase must be runnable and testable
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, especially for core algorithms
- **Observability First**: Instrument everything with metrics and tracing
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep `mesh-core` lightweight and portable

### Dependency Management

```toml
# Workspace-level dependencies for consistency
[workspace.dependencies]
# Core dependencies
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros"] }
tonic = { version = "0.12", features = ["tls"] }
prometheus = "0.13"

# Optional features
opentelemetry = { version = "0.23", optional = true }
quinn = { version = "0.11", optional = true }  # QUIC support
```

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: In each crate for individual components
- **Integration Tests**: In `mesh-dev` for cross-crate functionality
- **Property-Based Testing**: For scoring algorithms and state management
- **Mock Everything**: External dependencies (DCGM, runtimes) have mock implementations
